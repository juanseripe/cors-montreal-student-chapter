## Description

The CORS Montreal Student Chapter invites you to an industry panel with IVADO Labs, an applied AI and analytics team that helps organizations in Canada and around the world tackle complex decision-making problems using operations research and machine learning.

This event is aimed at students and early-career researchers who are curious about what happens after the paper: how an OR idea becomes a real product or decision process within a company. The discussion will cover how consulting projects are framed, what “OR + ML” looks like in practice, and the types of applications teams work on (planning, scheduling, routing, resource allocation, and more). We will also openly discuss career paths and what the transition from academia to industry can look like, including key skills, industry–academia collaborations, and what day-to-day roles are really like. The session will conclude with time for audience questions.

Panelists from IVADO Labs include a Vice President of Data Science, a Senior Director of Delivery Management, and two Principal Data Scientists.
