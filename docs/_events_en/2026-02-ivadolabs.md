## Description

The CORS Montreal Student Chapter invites you to an industry panel in partnership with IVADO Labs, an applied AI and analytics team that helps organizations in Canada and around the world tackle complex decision-making problems using operations research.

This event is aimed at students and early-career researchers interested in understanding what happens in industry: how an operations research idea becomes a real product or decision-making process within an organization. The discussion will explore how consulting projects are framed, what operations research looks like in practice, how it is integrated with machine learning and generative AI in end-to-end solutions, and the types of applications teams work on (planning, scheduling, routing, resource allocation, and more). We will also openly discuss career paths and the transition from academia to industry, including key skills to develop, industry–academia collaborations, and what day-to-day roles really look like. The session will conclude with time for audience questions.

Panelists from IVADO Labs include a Vice President of Data Science, a Senior Director of Delivery Management, and two Principal Data Scientists.
